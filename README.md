# Time Series Analysis of Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome

## Overview
This project focuses on the time series analysis of Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in Anhui Province, China. Using statistical models, the analysis aims to identify the relationship between HFRS incidence and key climatic and occupational variables.

## Summary
The project compares three regression models: a linear time series model with normally distributed residuals, a generalized linear model with Poisson-distributed residuals and a log link, and a generalized additive model with the same distributional features as the second model. The analysis concludes that the generalized additive model may be the most suitable for assessing the relationship between HFRS incidence and the independent variables.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Time-series data on HFRS incidence, density of Apodemus agrarius (a common rodent carrier of HFRS), and crop production were collected.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Spearman correlation analysis and regression modeling (linear, Poisson, and generalized additive models) were performed to assess the associations and predict HFRS incidence.
- **Model Evaluation**: Models were evaluated based on residual analysis, goodness of fit, and predictive accuracy.

## Results
- **Associations**: HFRS incidence was positively associated with density of A. agrarius and crop production, but inversely associated with differences in water level.
- **Model Comparison**: The generalized additive model demonstrated the best goodness-of-fit and short-term predictive ability.
- **Forecasting**: The fitted model was used to forecast future HFRS incidence.

## Conclusion
The analysis confirms the association between HFRS transmission and climatic and occupational factors. The generalized additive model is recommended for further assessment of this relationship.
